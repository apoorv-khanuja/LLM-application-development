# LLM Application Development
This repository documents my journey into the world of Large Language Model (LLMs) applications development. I will outline the lessons learned from two online courses hosted on [deeplearning.ai](https://www.deeplearning.ai/): 

1. [LangChain for LLM Application Development](https://learn.deeplearning.ai/langchain/lesson/1/introduction) and 
2. [LangChain Chat with Your Data](https://learn.deeplearning.ai/langchain-chat-with-your-data/lesson/1/introduction)
